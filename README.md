# Translator

Traslatos is a program written in Kotlin using Android Studio

The program was created by integrating GitHub and Android Studio with object-oriented programming.

This is an application created with the intention of learning Kotlin to start programming Android applications, but learning to handle the Kotlin base as well as possible before creating complex applications.
